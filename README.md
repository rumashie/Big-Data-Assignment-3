# Big-Data-Assignment-3

This project analyzes a breast cancer diagnosis dataset to develop machine learning models that predict whether a tumor is benign or malignant. The project utilizes various machine learning techniques to achieve high prediction accuracy. 
It was part of the Big Data Technology course (CSCI 493.76) at Hunter College in Spring 2024.

Tools Used: 
- Python
- Pandas (for data manipulation and cleaning)
- Scikit-learn (for implementing machine learning models)
- Matplotlib (for visualizations)

Machine Learning Models
- Decision Tree
- Support Vector Machine (SVM)
- Random Forest
